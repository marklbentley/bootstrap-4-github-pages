This is my site, it's not sure what it wants to be yet. So here is a little about me.

...

I am a web Developer, or at least trying my hardest to be, I have worked on a number of projects honing my skills.
In January 2017 I got the chance to be part of a project that involved another of my passions. An evolution in Rock and Metal radio.
